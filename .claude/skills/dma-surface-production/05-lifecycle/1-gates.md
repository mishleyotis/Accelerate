# Gates and verdicts

Four families with four different jobs and four different failure behaviours. The prefix is
part of the id — three unprefixed families once collided and one of them rendered to
clients.

| Prefix | Family | When it runs | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AG-nn` | Analytical | Inside synthesis, per claim, before anything is emitted | The claim changes or is dropped — the agent's own discipline |
| `SG-nn` | Safeguard | At submit — and the results render to the client | Recorded and disclosed. Does not block promotion. |
| `ET-nn` | Enrichment trigger | During synthesis, to send the agent looking | Not a failure — a prompt to enrich |
| `CG-nn` | Corpus | At build time, over the exported pack, corpus-wide | Fails the build |

Two more run at submit and are not G-numbered because they are structural rather than
analytical:

- **Contract pass** — required fields, types, word budgets, forbidden registers, terminal
  punctuation, id resolution by pattern.
- **Evidence pass** — every id resolves and belongs to this entity and run; every excerpt is
  verbatim; every source domain is identity-checked.

**Any evidence reason at all fails the submission.** An excerpt is either a copy of
something a document says or it is not evidence.

## The citation stack

| | Check | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | Cited ids are a subset of the bundle you were given | Reasoning that reached outside its grounding |
| V2 | No fabricated ids — by pattern **and** by database existence | Invented ids, including in the mint namespace |
| V3 | No fabricated entity-specific tokens unless in the run's own rows | Invented platforms, agents and vendors |
| V4 | Re-embed the output; require semantic agreement with the bundle | A fluent paraphrase that invents a claim while citing only real ids |

V4 is the one that matters most: text can satisfy V1–V3 and still say something the sources
do not support.

## Reading a verdict

```json
{ "gate_id": "CG-01", "section": "findings", "path": "findings[2].body",
  "message": "quoted 2.34/5 resolves to P3C2.1.1 = 2.10 (Δ 0.24 > 0.05)",
  "severity": "block" }
```

**Repair the cause, not the symptom.** This verdict is not asking you to write 2.10. It is
telling you that you read the score from one row and the name from another. Fix the pairing.

A verdict often names the checks that *passed* alongside the one that failed — that is
deliberate, so you can see which assertion actually broke rather than re-deriving all of
them.

## Cross-surface reconciliation

The same metric on two surfaces must agree or one is quarantined. Seven pairs are enforced:

| Pair | Assertion |
|---|---|
| O1 hero composite ↔ H4 workbook rollup | Agree to two decimals before either promotes |
| O8 financial trajectory ↔ C6 Context trajectory | Identical — C6 renders O8's section |
| T2 landscape counts ↔ T1 register | Recomputed from the register, never stored |
| O10 coverage denominator ↔ H4 cell set | Computed over the same cell set the heatmap serves |
| H3 alert cells ↔ H2 cell evidence | Every alerted cell is one the payload declared under-evidenced |
| P3 roadmap rec ids ↔ P2 recommendations | Every phase cites a recommendation the payload describes |
| Run history score ↔ O1 hero | Both average the four pillar means at the same precision |

## Safeguard gates render to the client

Three consequences:

- **Plain language.** A human sentence beside every gate, 8–18 words. A client reading a
  bare code learns nothing and distrusts everything.
- **A third state.** `NOT_RUN`, with a reason. A gate reporting PASS because it did not run
  is worse than one reporting FAIL.
- **A failing gate is not a blocked run.** Disclosure is the point. The assessment ships
  with its weakness stated.
